# Introduction

Welcome to data journalism. The main goal of this course is to expand your ability to report and tell stories using data. You will use these tools to discover trends in data. You will learn how to create and publish graphics and maps. It's hard work but it is a lot of fun and very rewarding.

We have some basic goals for you to reach in this class. By the end of the semester, we want you to have basic proficiency and independence with data analysis. We want you to be able to write about data clearly, using the Associated Press style as a benchmark. We want you to be able to find and download a dataset, clean it up, visualize it.

The skills you will learn in the coming weeks are in high demand in journalism and beyond. Examine this BuzzFeed job description from 2017:

"We're looking for someone with a passion for news and a commitment to using data to find amazing, important stories --- both quick hits and deeper analyses that drive conversations," the posting seeking a data journalist says. It goes on to list five things BuzzFeed is looking for: Excellent collaborator, clear writer, deep statistical understanding, knowledge of obtaining and restructuring data.

**"You should have a strong command of at least one toolset that (a) allows for filtering, joining, pivoting, and aggregating tabular data, and (b) enables reproducible workflows."**

You will learn these skills in this book. You'll get a taste of modern data journalism through Google Sheets and programming in R, a statistics language. You'll be challenged to think programmatically while thinking about a story you can tell to readers in a way that they'll want to read. Combining them together has the power to change policy and expose injustice.

## Installations

This book begins with a basic review of Google Sheets and then shifts to the R statistical language. To follow along, you'll do the following:

1.  Install the R language on your computer. Go to the [this website](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/), click download R based on your operating system. If that link somehow doesn't work, check [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/) and find a different location.

2.  Install [R Studio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop). The free version is great.

Going forward, you'll see passages like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

That is code that you'll need to run common software packages in your R Studio.
