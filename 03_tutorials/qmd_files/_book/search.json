    "text": "Jo Craven McGinty, then of The New York Times, used simple rates and ratios to discover that a 6-story brick New Jersey hospital was the most expensive in the nation. In 2012, Bayonne Medical Center “charged the highest amounts in the country for nearly one-quarter of the most common hospital treatments,” the Times story said.\nTo do this story, McGinty only needed to know the number of the procedures reported to the government and the total amount each hospital charged. Dividing those to find an average price, then ranking the most common procedures, led to this surprising result."

    "text": "3.1 Why numbers?\nUsing averages, percentages and percent change is the bread and butter of data journalism, leading to stories ranging from home price comparisons to school reports and crime trends. It may have been charming at one time for reporters to announce that they didn’t “do” math, but no longer. Instead, it is now an announcement that the reporter can only do some of the job. You will never be able to tackle complicated, in-depth stories without reviewing basic math.\nThe good news is that most of the math and statistics you need in a newsroom isn’t nearly as difficult as high school algebra. You learned it somewhere around the 4th grade. You then had a decade to forget it before deciding you didn’t like math. But mastering this most basic arithmetic again is a requirement in the modern age.\nIn working with typical newsroom math, you will need to learn how to:\n\nOvercome your fear of numbers\nIntegrate numbers into your reporting\nRoutinely compute averages, differences and rates\nSimplify and select the right numbers for your story\n\nWhile this chapter covers general tips, you can find specific instructions for typical newsroom math in this Appendix A, an except from Sarah Cohen’s outstanding book, Numbers in the Newsroom."

    "text": "3.2 Overcoming your fear of math\nWhen we learned to read, we got used to the idea that 26 letters in American English could be assembled into units that we understand without thinking – words, sentences, paragraphs and books. We never got the same comfort level with 10 digits, and neither did our audience.\nThink of your own reaction to seeing a page of words. Now imagine it as a page of numbers.\nInstead, picture the number “five”. It’s easy. It might be fingers or it might be a team on a basketball court. But it’s simple to understand.\nNow picture the number 275 million. It’s hard. Unfortunately, 275 billion isn’t much harder, even though it’s magnitudes larger. (A million seconds goes by in about 11 days but you may not have been alive for a billion seconds – about 36 years.)\nThe easiest way to get used to some numbers is to learn ways to cut them down to size by calculating rates, ratios or percentages. In your analysis, keep an eye out for the simplest accurate way to characterize the numbers you want to use. “Characterize” is the important word here – it’s not usually necessary to be overly precise so long as your story doesn’t hinge on a nuanced reading of small differences. (And is anything that depends on that news? It may not be.)\nHere’s one example of putting huge numbers in perspective. Pay attention to what you really can picture - it’s probably the $21 equivalent.\n\nThe Chicago hedge fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, for example, earns about $68.5 million a month after taxes, according to court filings made by his wife in their divorce. He has given a total of $300,000 to groups backing Republican presidential candidates. That is a huge sum on its face, yet is the equivalent of only $21.17 for a typical American household, according to Congressional Budget Office data on after-tax income.  “Buying Power”, Nicholas Confessore, Sarah Cohen and Karen Yourish, The New York Times, October 2015\n\nOriginally the reporters had written it even more simply, but editors found the facts so unbelievable that they wanted give readers a chance to do the math themselves. That’s reasonable, but here’s an even simpler way to say it: “earned nearly $1 billion after taxes…He has given $300,000 to groups backing candidates, the equivalent of a dinner at Olive Garden for the typical American family , based on Congressional Budget Office income data.” (And yes, the reporter checked the price for an Olive Garden meal at the time for four people.)"

    "text": "3.3 Put math in its place\nFor journalists, numbers – or facts – make up the third leg of a stool supported by human stories or anecdotes , and insightful comment from experts. They serve us in three ways:\n\nAs summaries. Almost by definition, a number counts something, averages something, or otherwise summarizes something. Sometimes, it does a good job, as in the average height of Americans. Sometimes it does a terrible job, as in the average income of Americans. Try to find summaries that accurately characterize the real world.\nAs opinions. Sometimes it’s an opinion derived after years of impartial study. Sometimes it’s an opinion tinged with partisan or selective choices of facts. Use them accordingly.\nAs guesses. Sometimes it’s a good guess, sometimes it’s an off-the-cuff guess. And sometimes it’s a hopeful guess. Even when everything is presumably counted many times, it’s still a (very nearly accurate) guess. Yes, the “audits” of presidential election results in several states in 2021 found a handful of errors – not a meaningful number, but a few just the same.\n\nOnce you find the humanity in your numbers, by cutting them down to size and relegating them to their proper role, you’ll find yourself less fearful. You’ll be able to characterize what you’ve learned rather than numb your readers with every number in your notebook. You may even find that finding facts on your own is fun."

This chapter will help you start seeing data reporting in a new way, by learning how to study great works of the craft as a writer rather than a reader.\nJelani Cobb tweeted, “an engineer doesn’t look at a bridge the same way pedestrians or drivers do.” They see it as a “language of angles and load bearing structures.” We just see a bridge. While he was referring to long-form writing, reporting with data can also be learned by example – if you spend enough time with the examples.\nAlmost all good writers and reporters try to learn from exemplary work. I know more than one reporter who studies prize-winning journalism to hone their craft. This site will have plenty of examples, but you should stay on the lookout for others."

    "text": "2.1 Read like a reporter\nTry to approach data or empirical reporting as a reporter first, and a consumer second. The goal is to triangulate how the story was discovered, reported and constructed. You’ll want to think about why this story, told this way, at this time, was considered newsworthy enough to publish when another approach on the same topic might not have been.\n\nWhat were the questions?\nIn data journalism, we often start with a tip, or a hypothesis. Sometimes it’s a simple question. Walt Bogdanich of The New York Times is renowned for seeing stories around every corner. Bogdanich has said that the prize-winning story “A Disability Epidemic Among a Railroad’s Retirees” came from a simple question he had when railway workers went on strike over pension benefits – how much were they worth? The story led to an FBI investigation and arrests, along with pension reform at the largest commuter rail in the country.\nThe hypothesis for some stories might be more directed. In 2021, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at ASU published “Little victims everywhere”, a set of stories on the lack of justice for survivors of child sexual assault on Native American reservations. That story came after previous reporters for the center analyzed data from the Justice Department showing that the FBI dropped most of the cases it investigated, and the Justice Department then only prosecuted about half of the matters referred to it by investigators. The hypothesis was that they were rarely pursued because federal prosecutors – usually focused on immigration, white collar crime and drugs – weren’t as prepared to pursue violent crime in Indian Country.\nWhen studying a data-driven investigation, try to imagine what the reporters were trying to prove or disprove, and what they used to do it. In journalism, we rely on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. It’s not enough to prove the “numbers” or have the statistical evidence. That is just the beginning of the story. We are supposed to ground-truth them with the stories of actual people and places.\n\n\nGo beyond the numbers\nIt’s easy to focus on the numbers or statistics that make up the key findings, or the reason for the story. Some reporters make the mistake of thinking all of the numbers came from the same place – a rarity in most long-form investigations. Instead, the sources have been woven together and are a mix of original research and research done by others. Try to pay attention to any sourcing done in the piece. Sometimes, it will tell you that the analysis was original. Other times it’s more subtle.\nBut don’t just look at the statistics being reported in the story. In many (most?) investigations, some of the key people, places or time elements come directly from a database.\nSarah Cohen at Arizona State University analyzed the Paycheck Protection Program loan data for ProPublica and found a handful of sketchy-looking records from a single county in coastal New Jersey. It turned out to be a pretty good story.\nOften, the place that a reporter visits is determined by examples found in data. In this story on rural development funds, all of the examples came from an analysis of the database. Once the data gave us a good lead, the reporters examined press releases and other easy-to-get sources before calling and visiting the recipients or towns."

Could they have come from the data?\nWhat do you think came first – a narrative single example that was broadened by data (naively, qualitative method), or a big idea that was illustrated with characters (quantitative method)?\nWhat records were used? Were they public records, leaks, or proprietary data?\nWhat methods did they use? Did they do their own testing, use statistical analysis, or geographic methods? You won’t always know, but look for a methodology section or a description alongside each story.\nHow might you localize or adapt these methods to find your own stories?\nPick out the key findings (usually in the nut graf or in a series of bullets after the opening chapter): are they controversial? How might they have been derived? What might have been the investigative hypothesis? Have they given critics their due and tried to falsify their own work?\nHow effective is the writing and presentation of the story? What makes it compelling journalism rather than a dry study? How might you have done it differently? Is a video story better told in text, or would a text story have made a good documentary? Are the visual elements well integrated? Does the writing draw you in and keep you reading? Think about structure, story length, entry points and graphics all working together.\nAre you convinced? Are there holes or questions that didn’t get addressed?"

We’re seeking stories, not studies. Recognizing news in data is one of the hardest skills for less experienced reporters new to data journalism. This list of potential newsworthy data points is adapted from Paul Bradshaw’s “Data Journalism Heist”.\n\n\n\n\nCompare the claims of powerful people and institutions against facts – the classic investigative approach.\nReport on unexpected highs and lows (of change, or of some other characteristic)\nLook for outliers – individual values that buck a trend seen in the rest\nVerify or bust some myths\nFind signs of distress, happiness or dishonesty or any other emotion.\nUncover new or under-reported long-term trends.\nFind data suggesting your area is the same or different than most others of its kind.\n\nBradshaw also did a recent study of data journalism pieces: “Here are the angles journalists use most often to tell the stories in data”, in Online Journalism Blog. I’m not sure I agree, only because he’s looking mainly at visualizations rather than stories, but they’re worth considering."
